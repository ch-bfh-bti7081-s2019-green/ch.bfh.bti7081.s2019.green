# Lessons Learnt

## Lessons Learnt

### Do
- Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- First make the basic framework, then add features (ex. DB, Login, etc.)

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Never use Vaadin
- Postgres is better than SQLite
- plan less features, especially at the beginning
- Never make a project with new technologies that nobody in the team knows
- First make the basicframework, then the features(ex. Login)
- Never ever use Vaadin!
=======
### Don't
- Attempt a project with completely unknown technologies.
- Plan too many features at once
- Choose a framework with lackluster docs

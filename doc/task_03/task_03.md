# Requirement Review
With this document we review the Requirements Document for [Team Blue](https://github.com/LucaRitz/ch.bfh.bti7081.s2019.blue).

   **Page** **Criteria**      **Reason / Comment / Improvement suggestion**

         4  Traceability      The origin of the requirements is not explicitly stated\
                              (in this case it would be the interviewees). Perhaps\
                              add it to the introduction or to the indiviual\
                              requirements.
                              
     8 + 9 Adaptability       The defined requirements seem to be neetly organised and\
                              independent of each other.
                              
        11 Adaptability       Take note that any changes to the datamodel will likely\
                              require changes to both clients which connect to the\
                              backend via API. This means that changes may potentially\
                              cause twice as much work to implement.

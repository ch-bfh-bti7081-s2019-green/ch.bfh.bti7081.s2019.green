# Requirement Review
With this document we review the Requirements Document for [Team Blue](https://github.com/LucaRitz/ch.bfh.bti7081.s2019.blue).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   **Page** **Criteria**      **Reason / Comment / Improvement suggestion**
----------- ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------         
      4 + 5 Validity		  The Backoffice Client and Frontoffice Client seem to\
      						  provide all necessary requirements for the team leader\
      						  and staff member. No flaws.

      4	+ 6 Consistency       By scheduling employees and patients services, it could\
                              be difficult to consider appointment changes at short
                              notice. But on the whole, processes are clearly described.

          4 Traceability      The origin of the requirements is not explicitly stated
                              (in this case it would be the interviewees). Perhaps
                              add it to the introduction or to the indiviual
                              requirements.

          8 Comprehensibility Variants are hard to follow. An (activity) diagram or
                              multiple tables might be easier.
                              
      8 + 9 Adaptability      The defined requirements seem to be neatly organised and
                              independent of each other.
                              
         11 Adaptability      Take note that any changes to the datamodel will likely
                              require changes to both clients which connect to the
                              backend via API. This means that changes may potentially
                              cause twice as much work to implement.                              
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scope may be too large for the time constraints of this course,
but we don't view that as anything worth dockign points for.

**We award Team Blue x / 10 points.**
